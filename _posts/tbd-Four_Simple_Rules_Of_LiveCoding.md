Music is a collection of sounds. Making music is a creative process - there is no such thing as wrong. SonicPi makes it easy to live-code sounds. Therefore, anyone can make music that can be said to be good.

This could be the end of the blog.

But, just becuase there is no such thing as wrong when it comes to music, this doesn't mean you, or many others, will think that the sounds you put together are good. As we everything, we have to practice long and hard at our craft to become proficient, and as we start out as novices it is useful to have guidelines to help us on our way. So, below are my four simlpe rules for live-coding music, which I'll exemplify with a track that I live-coded on stage for Yow! Sydney. Use the rules as a guide, and go and have fun created the soundtrack for your day!
