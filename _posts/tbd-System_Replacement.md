<h2>The Evolution of Systems</h2>

Complicated systems are always evolving.  Without change, any system will become redundant or fall into demise and eventually die. Survival of the fittest means adapting to the environment and out-competing the competition.

Human's have done a great job over the millennia of evolving, surviving and thriving, but all the <a href="http://io9.com/the-most-unfortunate-design-flaws-in-the-human-body-1518242787">modifications</a>  have come at a cost. The initial design included many violations of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle">single responsibility principle</a> that still cause us issues today. Perhaps the most obvious and costly of these is the dual role of the pharynx, responsible for both respiration and ingestion, and the cause of many deaths. The original requirements were for us to move on all four limbs, and adapting the design for us to be able to run on two legs, although successful, has come with many compromises that we still suffer from today. These include our over-loaded backs, complicated foot structure, and extremely narrow birth canal. And then there were features that were just never implemented, such as an ability to synthesise all of the vitamins, such as Vitamin C, that we require. Wouldn't it be great if we could just redesign the human body from scratch to meet our current requirements?

<h2>Case study: The Apartment Block</h2>

<h3>Current Situation</h3>

The redesign of the human body is going to fall outside of the scope of this blog post. Instead, we’re going to look at when a software system re-write could make sense over the gradual modification and updating of an existing system. In order to do this, we're first going to consider a city apartment block.

The apartment block in question, let’s call it Ap-Art, is now a few decades old. It has served the local community well, but is now beginning to show it’s age. When it was first built it stood out amongst the crowd. It set a new standard in city living, with luxury features and quality service that hadn’t been seen before. But now the competition has caught up and Ap-Art has started to see rental demand fall off.

The owners of Ap-Art want to reverse this trend. Their bottom-line is being hit from two angles: income is down due to the lower rents that they can demand, given they are no-longer seen as premium; and costs are rising as they try to keep the building in good repair. They know that if they don’t change something soon then this slide toward demise will lead them to bankruptcy.

The owners aren’t the only ones that are not happy.       

The residents are voicing growing annoyance at the disruptions in services. The elevators are out of action at least once a week, and the pool room has been closed for months. The carpets in the hallways are starting to look warn, and low water pressure in the decaying pipes makes showers almost unusable. They’re still expected to pay though, and the premium for the building just isn’t worth what it was, especially with all the new competition around.

The maintenance team isn’t happy, either. Yes, they have plenty of work, but fixing the same old pipes gets harder each time they are repaired, and has become no fun at all. Neither is sourcing the replacement parts for all the now obsolete air-conditioning equipment – the time and cost this takes could surely be used in a more productive way, if only the system was changed.

Things aren’t much better for the Management Team. The owners are always demanding new features and facilities in the building so as to attract more residents, but nothing is easy anymore. The new bathroom upgrades sounded like a good idea, but in almost every apartment there were problems connecting to the existing plumbing, and the fragile walls just crumbled when the old tiles were removed. Worse still was the fiasco with the sports center. New regulations meant that the electrics for the gym had to all be upgraded when the equipment was changed, but no-one anticipated that this would lead to a surge in the pool filter system, leaving the pool still out of action months later. Now when they are asked to make any improvements in the building they draw in their breath and reply that it will cost a lot and there is no way of knowing how long it will take.

And then there’s the leasing company. They’re the immediate face of the company – the key interaction with the residents. When everything was shiny and new the job was a joy, but now they spend their days dealing with complaints from current residents and mostly polite declines from prospective renters.


<h3>Drivers for System Replacement</h3>

So, what’s to be done? How do we go from the current unhappy state to one where everything is shiny and new again? The current system is a money pit, where time and resources are just being used to try to keep the status quo, and efforts to make improvements are difficult, lengthy and costly. Is now the time for a system replacement? Do we need to knock down the building and start again?

The solution sounds pretty drastic, but there are times when a full system replacement makes sense. There are three potential drivers for this:

1.	Change the business
2.	Run the business
3.	Manage the business

Let’s look at these in turn.

<h4>Change the business:</h4> 

There are many ways that we might want to change Ap-Art, and some of these just may not be possible within our current system. 

We may wish to add more features and functionality. For instance, many potential residents are demanding in-unit washer-dryers. It would be great to be able to include these and free up the space of the communal launderette, but the units weren’t designed to have space for the extra appliances, so retro-fitting them will involve complicated unit redesigns that are sure to have knock-on effects on other functionality within the units. And we already know to expect plumbing issues…

It would also be great if we were able to lease 200 units rather than 100, but there is only so much space within the building, and the existing architecture cannot be expanded to add more floors.

<h4>Run the business:</h4>

Even if we don’t want to add new features and functionality, it may make business sense to replace the system in order to keep the business running efficiently.

At Ap-Art, maintaining the current building is costly and inefficient. A large maintenance team is required to fix all the breaks and keep the building standing, and the spare parts are getting harder to source. And even with all the maintenance the residents are still not getting consitent use of all the basic facilities that they were promised.   

<h4>Manage the business?</h4>

Even if Ap-Art could get maintenance under control and there was no desire to make any changes to the business, it may still make sense to do a system replacement. For a system to remain viabale it must keep functioning and be successful in the face of inevitable changes to requirements and to the occurance of unexpected events. For example, would Ap-Art be able to respond to changes in security or building regulation requirements, whilst maintaining full building functionality?

<h3>The cost of Change</h3>

Understanding the drivers for change and all the different stakeholders impacted means it's possible to calculate costs for  
Building a new apartment block from scratch will take considerable time and be costly
